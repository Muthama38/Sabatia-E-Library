SABATIA EYE HOSPITAL
E-LIBRARY SYSTEM PROPOSAL
BACKGROUND
To streamline learning experience at the training center, access to learning materials is a key consideration to enable learners to reach their full potential with ease. The following proposal for an e-library system is an effort to make this possible and probable. 
SCOPE
The system will be designed for access to learners and trainers, a platform where trainers can remotely share learning materials with the students and the students can also remotely access these materials.
Some of the materials will be:
Books (PDF and e-Books)
Videos and clips (Audio Visual)
Magazines and medical journals
Medical blogs
SYSTEM DESIGN
Due to the transitional nature of the training, a system that would offer continuous and uninterrupted supply of learning materials would be more effective. 
A web based system ensures smooth sharing, access and update of such materials hence the proposed system is a web interface that would offer the proposed service to the users. The system will be developed using web languages like HTML & CSS, PhP and Javascript and MySQL for database.
SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION
The proposed system will be designed to work on variety of devices like laptops, desktop PCs, tablets and mobile phones.
